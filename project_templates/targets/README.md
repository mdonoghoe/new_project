Project template - targets
================

This folder contains a standardised template project directory that can be used to manage statistical consultation projects. This approach provides a streamlined workflow by removing repetitive administrative processes. A standardised workflow also facilitates collaboration within cross-functional teams. This project structure is identical and successful for both simple and large-scale projects.

The **targets** template contains the near-minimal structure needed for a simple consultation project that relies on the [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) package for dependency management.

Although this workflow has been developed in R (based on the [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net) package), the broader principles discussed here are applicable to any scripting language and non-coding projects alike.

Each directory in this template project has a _README.md_ file that briefly describes its intended purpose. This is based on the work of [Paul Stevenson](https://github.com/pgstevenson) from the Biometrics group at Telethon Kids Institute (specifically, [the `basic` branch of his `new_project` repository](https://github.com/TelethonKids/new_project/tree/basic)). Paul has written further about this template project structure [here](https://telethonkids.wordpress.com/2019/07/24/how-do-you-organise-your-r-project-this-is-what-we-do/).

Further information about configuring automation _via._ ProjectTemplate can be found in <config/README.md>.
